# OLTP & OLAP Integrated Retail Data Warehouse

## Overview
A simulation of a real-world retail system with an OLTP schema for daily operations, an OLAP star schema for analytics, and a custom ETL pipeline. Enables insights through analytical queries on sales, customers, and products. Ideal for practicing data modeling and BI.

## Structure
- `/oltp_schema/`: Contains the transactional schema
- `/olap_schema/`: Contains the star schema
- `/etl_scripts/`: SQL for ETL operations
- `/sample_data/`: Placeholder for CSV files (optional)
- `/queries/`: SQL queries for business analytics

## Steps
1. Set up OLTP tables.
2. Populate sample transactional data.
3. Set up OLAP warehouse with a star schema.
4. Run ETL to populate fact_sales.
5. Execute analytical queries.
